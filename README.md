### Hi there! I'm getting back into things!

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Blender. (Slowly.)
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a Metroid Fusion homage, eventually!
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Godot and Unity.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about that one project I did in college!
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: I'm @JenHusky on Telegram and IndigoNocturna on Discord!
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her or it/its!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a Jill of many trades, and I'm a fast learner! I'm neurodivergent, and that's cool!
